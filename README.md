## Introduction :

The Bluetooth LED Matrix project is an innovative IoT project designed to control an LED matrix using Bluetooth technology. This project allows users to display custom messages and patterns on an LED matrix using a smartphone or any Bluetooth-enabled device.




## Features 

- Control LED matrix wirelessly via Bluetooth
- Display custom messages and patterns
- User-friendly interface for sending commands
## Components Required
- LED Matrix
- Bluetooth Module (e.g., HC-05)
- Arduino or any compatible microcontroller
- Power supply
- Connecting wires
- Breadboard or PCB (optional)


## Setup & Installation

Install my project with git clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kunalpanche/IOT-PROJECTS.git
cd IOT-PROJECTS/bluetooth_led_matrix

```
## Hardware Setup

- Connect the LED matrix to the microcontroller.
- Connect the Bluetooth module to the microcontroller (TX to RX, RX to TX).
- Power the setup using an appropriate power supply.


## Upload Code
- Open the Arduino IDE.
- Load the provided code from the bluetooth_led_matrix directory.
- Select the correct board and port.
- Upload the code to the microcontroller.
